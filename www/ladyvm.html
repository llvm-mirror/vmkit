<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
The development of a complete Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
implementation is a tedious process which involves knowledge in different
areas: garbage collection, just in time compilation, interpretation, file
parsing, data structures, etc. The result is that developing its own virtual 
machine requires a considerable amount of man/year. In this paper we show that
one can implement a JVM with third party software and with performance
comparable to industrial and top open-source JVMs. Our proof-of-concept 
implementation uses existing versions of a garbage collector, a just in
time compiler, and the base library, and is robust enough to
execute complex Java applications such as the OSGi Felix
implementation and the Tomcat servlet container.
